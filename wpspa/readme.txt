Use your WordPress site as the back-end for a completely data-driven single page application.

== Description ==

WPSPA is a WordPress plugin that works with the [json-api](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/json-api/) plugin and the [WPSPA](http://github.com/localnerve/wpspa) client to enable a high-performance, data-driven single page application architecture.
If you are not planning on using the WPSPA client, this plugin is probably not for you.

Of course, you can use this plugin together with the WPSPA client to maximize the performance of your Wordpress driven SPA.
For a full front-end example implementation, check out [WPSPA](http://github.com/localnerve/wpspa).

Features include:

* Simplified menu api over json-api alone.
* Extends standard Wordpress menu to allow you to specify arbitrary app routes and metadata for menu items.
* Automatically crawls the content of your posts and pages for local site links and sends those down as deep routes to the SPA.
* Deep routes can be classified as prefetch or on-demand.


== Installation ==

1. Install WPSPA either via the WordPress.org plugin directory, or by uploading the files to your server
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress or by using the link provided by the plugin installer.
